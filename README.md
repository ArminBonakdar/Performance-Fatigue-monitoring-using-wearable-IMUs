Performance Fatigue Analysis in Manual Handling Tasks

Performance fatigue is a key factor in work-related musculoskeletal disorders. This study analyzes fatigue progression during manual handling tasks (MHT) by evaluating joint kinematics and coordinative variability using inertial measurement units (IMUs).

Methodology:

Eight participants performed repetitive lifting, carrying, and lowering tasks while reporting fatigue levels.
Joint angles in the sagittal plane were analyzed for mean, peak excursions, and variability.
Mutual information theory assessed coordination between adjacent joints.

Inputs:
- Number of participants: 8 (each two trial)
- IMU placements: Sternum, Sacrum, Shoude (R), Elbow (R), Pelvis (R), Thigh (R), Shank (R)
